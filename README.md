# Stack and Queue Operations

This C++ program demonstrates stack and queue operations using the STL. It reads integers from a text file (`input.txt`), pushes them onto a stack or queue, and then checks if the sum of the elements is negative.

## Usage

### Compilation
Compile the program using a C++ compiler supporting C++11 or later. Here's an example using g++:

g++ stack_operations_test.cpp -o stack_operations_test
g++ queue_operations_test.cpp -o queue_operations_test
